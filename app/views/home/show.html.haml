          needed a web app to inform their members in Cleveland about the effects that a newly negotiated collective bargaining agreement would have on their compensation. The complexity of the previous salary scale (which had 216 different ranks) and the various potential outcomes for each member made provide accurate, personalized results to each members a challenge. Five Tool Development built a calculator that calculated each member's potential salary outcomes and displayed those results in a responsive design that looks great on the desktop and mobile phones.
